            <h2>NDR C Regex</h2>

            <h4>1. Using the library</h4>
            <hr>
            The NDR_CRegex library provides the functionality to apply regular expression patterns to strings of text.
            The regular expression patterns are compiled into a graph structure which is used for matching against any text string
            <br><br>
            The doxygen generated documetation for the exposed functionality of the NDR_CRegex library can be found at "NDR_CRegex/documentation/html/index.html" (open with your browser)
            <br><br>
            The NDR_LAP library provides 4 main functions to handle lexical analysis and parsing for compiler generation.<br>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <li><pre><b>void NDR_InitRegex(NDR_Regex* cRegex)</b> - For initializing values within the NDR_Regex struct after memory has been allocated</pre></li>
                <li><pre><b>int NDR_CompileRegex(NDR_Regex* cRegex, char* regexString)</b> - For compiling the struct with a given regex pattern string</pre></li>
                <li><pre><b>NDR_MatchResult NDR_MatchRegex(NDR_Regex* cRegex, char* token)</b> - For matching the already compiled regex to a given token string</pre></li>
                <li><pre><b>void NDR_DestroyRegex(NDR_Regex* graph)</b> - For freeing the memory allocated to the NDR_Regex struct after use</pre></li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <br>
            In addition to the above, there is an enum <b>"NDR_MatchResult"</b> that provides a number of options for checking the result of the "NDR_MatchRegex" function which are 
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <li><pre><b>NDR_REGEX_FAILURE</b> - For checking if an error state was reached during matching</pre></li>
                <li><pre><b>NDR_REGEX_NOMATCH</b> - For checking if the pattern was unable to match any of the token string</pre></li>
                <li><pre><b>NDR_REGEX_PARTIALMATCH</b> - For checking if the pattern was able to match but the token string ended before the regular expression pattern</pre></li>
                <li><pre><b>NDR_REGEX_COMPLETEMATCH</b> - For checking if the pattern was able to completely match to the end of the regular expression pattern</pre></li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <br>
            
            To see how the regex patterns are designed, click the "Pattern Specifications" tab at the top of the page to see the specifications.<br>
            To demonstrate these items in use, an example program is provided below.

            <h2>NDR Regex Pattern Specifications</h2>
            <br>

            To actually use regular expressions to perform text matching operations, you must first define the regular expression pattern.<br><br>
            
            <br>
            <h4>1. Components of NDR Regex patterns</h4>
            <hr>
            
            Below is a list of the different components and characters that can be used to create a variety of regular expression patterns<br>
            
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <li><b>$</b> - When placed as the first character in the regex pattern, will mean that the regex will only match a token if matching starts at the first character</li>
                <li><b>%</b> - When placed as the last character in the regex pattern (without a leading escape character '\', will mean that the regex will only match a token if matching ends at the last character</li>
                <li><b>\</b> - Is the escape character and can be used to force special characters to be used as the character itself</li>
                <li><b>?</b> - Is a special character to mark a character, character class, or word as optional</li>
                <li><b>*</b> - Is a special character to mark a character, character class, or word as optional or repeatable any number of times (0 - infinity)</li>
                <li><b>+</b> - Is a special character to mark a character, character class, or word as mandatory and repeatable any number of times (1 - infinity)</li>
                <li><b>.</b> - Is a special character to represent every possible character</li>
                <li><b>^</b> - Is a special character that will negate everything in a character class if and only if it is the first character immediately after the opening character '[' of a character class</li>
                <li><b>|</b> - Is a special character that allows for creating different paths for matching according to the logical "or". It must be used with parentheses enclosed words only</li>
                <li><b>N</b> - Is a special character that must be escaped to represent everything except the '\n' newline character</li>
                <li><b>e</b> - Is a special character that must be escaped to represent every possible character</li>
                <li><b>E</b> - Is a special character that must be escaped to represent no character at all</li>
                <li><b>d</b> - Is a special character that must be escaped to represent the digits</li>
                <li><b>D</b> - Is a special character that must be escaped to represent everything that is not a decimal digit</li>
                <li><b>s</b> - Is a special character that must be escaped to represent white space ' ' and '\t'</li>
                <li><b>S</b> - Is a special character that must be escaped to represent everthing that is not whitespace</li>
                <li><b>w</b> - Is a special character that must be escaped to represent word characters</li>
                <li><b>W</b> - Is a special character that must be escaped to represent everything except forword characters</li>
                <li><b>'['</b> and <b>']'</b> - Are special characters that create and finish character classes respectively. Everything inside of a single character class will be optional for comparison to a single character</li>
                <li><b>'('</b> and <b>')'</b> - Are special characters that create and finish words respectively. Everything inside of a word will be treated as its own individual section of the matching pattern</li>
            </ul>
            In addition to these, the standard special characters of the C programming language should be treated as normal special characters such as '\n' for specifying a newline
